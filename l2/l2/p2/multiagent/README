1. Multi-agent search : You are required to implement multi-agent search techniques (minimax and minimax with alpha-beta pruning)
   in this module

2. You will be implementing the algorithm in 'controller2.py'. A function is defined in the file as :
		def musketeerMove(board):
         	
		You are given the board state as an input argument. Your task is to compute the best possible move for
		musketeer taking this board as an input state.

        Your output should be in the following format:
		[[x1,y1],[x2,y2]]
     
        The above output is interpreted as the musketeer at board position (x1,y1) is to be moved to (x2,y2).
		
At the time of submission, change controller2.py to rollNumber.py and submit this script only
